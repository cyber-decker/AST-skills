# Risk Identification
* [Define the software-system or part of a system, which is to have risk based testing analysis (e.g. is it full, partial system, a component, an element, etc.)](DefineTheSoftwareSystemForRiskBasedTestingAnalysis.md)
* [Identify ground rules and assumptions](IdentifyGroundRulesAndAssumptions.md)
* [Identify risk by name and with a description](IdentifyRiskByNameAndWithADescription.md)

### Our Working Definition:

Risk Identification:\
The process of examining the program areas and each critical technical process to identify and document the associated risk.

### A context where I used this skill:

I used this during the test impact I created for a test assignment. I try to identify risks by talking to several people. These can be the Business Analist, End User, Developers, Solution Designers.
I write down the risks in a so called Risk List. This list is input for my [Risk Analyses](RiskAnalyses.md)

### How I'd recommend someone learn this skill:

Risk Identification comes to common sense. You talk to people who can provide you information about risk of a feature, application or solution. Collect the information and work further with that.
Note that there are various ways of "talking to people"
